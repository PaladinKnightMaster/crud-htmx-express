# CRUD Application With Express and HTMX

Creating a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application is a great way to understand the basics of web development. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a working application that allows you to add, view, edit, and delete tasks. Let's get coding! ðŸ˜¸

## Features

- Add new tasks
- View existing tasks
- Edit tasks
- Delete tasks
- Dynamic updates without page reload using HTMX

## API

* `GET /api/todos`: Returns the list of todos
* `POST /api/todos`: Adds a new todo to the list
* `PUT /api/todos/:id`: Updates an existing todo based on the provided ID
* `DELETE /api/todos/:id`: Deletes a todo based on the provided ID

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PaladinKnightMaster/crud-htmx-express.git
    cd crud-htmx-express
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Application

To run the application, open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Start the server with the following command:

```bash
node src/server.js
```
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see your CRUD application running. You can add, edit, and delete tasks, and the changes will be reflected without reloading the page.
